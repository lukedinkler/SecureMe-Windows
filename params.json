  "body": "### Welcome to SecureMe!\r\nI started this project with a friend as a part of the CyberPatriot (Cyber Defense) Competition of which I was a part of, and It evolved into an idea: In a world where so many people have computer problems, The reason behind it is the idea is that most people don't know how to properly manage their computers. That is why I developed this piece of software. I want to give everyone an easy way to manage and secure their desktop or laptop PCs.\r\n\r\n### It's Geared towards Grandpa.\r\nYou know that one person, who can't use a computer to save their life? The clean, easy-to-navigate UI of SecureMe should even allow and empower them to keep their computer in check.\r\n\r\n### Full PC Management and Security:\r\nSecureMe allows anyone to manage all the important aspects of their computer. Management options include: Processes, Services, Software Packages, Ports, and more.\r\n\r\n### Looking for the latest release?\r\nFor now, releases are being hosted by GitHub, so click here to download the latest & greatest: https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows/releases\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact:\r\nAny problems with the software or simply suggestions for new updates?
