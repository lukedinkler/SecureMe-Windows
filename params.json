  "body": "### Welcome to SecureMe!\r\nI started this project with a friend as a part of the CyberPatriot (Cyber Defense) Competition of which I was a part of, and It evolved into an idea: We live in a world where a _lot_ of people have computer problems. One big reason for this is that most people don't know how to properly manage and protect their computers. That is why I developed this piece of software. I want to give everyone an easy way to manage and secure their desktop or laptop PCs.\r\n\r\n### It's Geared towards Grandpa.\r\nWe all know that person who can't use a computer to save their life. Well, the clean, easy-to-navigate UI of SecureMe should allow and empower even them to keep their computer in check.\r\n\r\n### Full PC Management and Security:\r\nSecureMe allows anyone to manage all the important aspects of their computer. Management options include: Processes, Services, Software Packages, Ports, and more. Right off the bat, SecureMe gives you two options for automatically securing your computer: Full and Basic Secure. Basic Secure should be enough to ensure that your computer fixes the major vulnerabilities, but if you want more, Full Secure will lock down your computer standards to (practically) government standards. Additionally, another option, \"Manual Secure\", allows you to patch/secure individual things from a list.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11169798/19939116/09b5db88-a0fe-11e6-9e20-68a7fa6c4202.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Looking for the latest release?\r\nFor now, releases are being hosted by GitHub, so click here to download the latest & greatest: https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows/releases\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact:\r\nAny problems with the software or simply suggestions for new updates?
