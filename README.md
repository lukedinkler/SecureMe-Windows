# SecureMe-WinSec
A User-friendly application that allows users to automatically and fully secure their Windows PC and manage their computer's users, processes, services, applications, monitor their ports, ect.

SecureMe allows anyone to manage all the important aspects of their computer. Management options include: Processes, Services, Software Packages, Ports, and more. Right off the bat, SecureMe gives you two options for automatically securing your computer: Full and Basic Secure. Basic Secure should be enough to ensure that your computer fixes the major vulnerabilities, but if you want more, Full Secure will lock down your computer standards to (practically) government standards. Additionally, another option, “Manual Secure”, allows you to patch/secure individual things from a list.
