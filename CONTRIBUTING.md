# Contributing to SecureMe

We welcome people to contribute to SecureMe and are open to any ideas for improvement! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 
## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep SecureMe open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general security support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows/issues) to our main [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows). Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows/pulls) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows/issues) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](https://github.com/lukedinkler/SecureMe-Windows/pulls).
