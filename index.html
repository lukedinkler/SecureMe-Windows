<p>I started this project with a friend as a part of the CyberPatriot (Cyber Defense) Competition of which I was a part of, and It evolved into an idea: We live in a world where a <em>lot</em> of people have computer problems. One big reason for this is that most people don't know how to properly manage and protect their computers. That is why I developed this piece of software. I want to give everyone an easy way to manage and secure their desktop or laptop PCs.</p>

<p>We all know that person who can't use a computer to save their life. Well, the clean, easy-to-navigate UI of SecureMe should allow and empower even them to keep their computer in check.</p>
